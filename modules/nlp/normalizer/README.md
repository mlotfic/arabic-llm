I'll convert your Arabic text normalization configuration into a clean YAML structure with Hydra integration and Pydantic validation.I've converted your Arabic text normalization configuration into a comprehensive YAML-based system with Hydra and Pydantic integration. Here's what I've created:

## Key Features:

1. **Clean YAML Configuration** (`arabic_config.yaml`):
   - Human-readable structure with clear comments
   - Organized by language/script types
   - Configurable pipeline order
   - Processing options

2. **Pydantic Validation** (`arabic_normalizer.py`):
   - Strong type checking for all configuration fields
   - Validation of pipeline steps
   - Clear error messages for invalid configurations
   - Structured data models

3. **Hydra Integration**:
   - Easy configuration loading and management
   - Support for configuration overrides
   - Command-line interface capabilities

## Main Improvements:

- **Modular Design**: Each language/script mapping is separate and configurable
- **Flexible Pipeline**: You can reorder or disable normalization steps
- **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and logging
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in logging and benchmarking
- **Easy to Extend**: Simple to add new language mappings or processing steps

## Usage:

```python
# Simple usage
config = load_config_from_yaml("arabic_config.yaml")
normalizer = ArabicTextNormalizer(config)
clean_text = normalizer.clean_text("your Arabic text here")

# Or with Hydra decorator
python arabic_normalizer.py
```

The system maintains all your original functionality while making it much more maintainable and configurable. You can easily modify the YAML file to add new character mappings, change the processing order, or adjust normalization options without touching the code.
